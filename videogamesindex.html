    <h2>My personal favorite</h2>
    <p class="p3">There were a lot of good games that came out this year and my personal favorite is <a href="#goty">Star Wars: Jedi Survivor</a> because it's an amazing sequel that improves upon the first game in numerous ways. The combat is so much fun, customization is improved, and the game has many so many good characters. Overall, this is just a phenomenal <em>Star Wars</em> game</p>
